Use throw the ball to review assigned reading:\\nHave students prepare a list of questions and answers based on the reading. Then have them sit in a circle.

Have students give each other feedback and explain why the answer their peer gave was correct or not. \\n\\n2. Use 2 balls to get students out of their seats: (requires 2 balls)\\nHave students stand and form two circles. Give one ball to a student in each circle.
